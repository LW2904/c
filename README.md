### strip_comments

**Exercise 1-23**

Strips a code file passed through stdin of comments, passing it to stdout as it is processed. Works with all languages which follow Cs comment syntax (C++, JS & co, Java, ...).

### check_syntax

**Exercise 1-24**

Checks a C code file for rudimentary syntax errors like unmatched parentheses, brackets and braces.

Since the checks are performed at such a basic level, this will work for a number of languages with syntax similar to C.

### find_substr

**Exercise 2-5**

Relevant function: `any(char *base, char *sub)`. Returns the index of the string `sub` within `base`, or -1 if it was not found.
